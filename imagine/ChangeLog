WARNING: This is more like a draft!

=demlinks-0.0.17
LU: 21 Aug 2005
* added new global timer gTimer
* made key &mouse use same timer: gTimer
* changed timer of inputs(mouse&key) to keep the time difference between them inputs
* made granularity of gTimer (and all its descendants) = 1000 miliseconds / second.
$ the goal is to execute the actions depending on the diff between the inputs,
that long to be the pause between the executed actions, same as the diff
between the inputs. Hmm....

=demlinks-0.0.16
LU: 19 Aug 2005
* done some cleanups
$ must do smooth motion while holding key down, but not with flags since we need replay of input/actions; we need smth like speed of game in its time, speed regulation; hmm ON/OFF type actions, OR CONTINOUS type actions...

=demlinks-0.0.15
LU: 19 Aug 2005
* introduced flags

=demlinks-0.0.14
LU: 18 Aug 2005
* at least the keys work somehow even tho there's some stray effect when turning the data displayed is no longer in line... oh yeah you can move if u repeatedly press keys
$ need to do Flags array but with a counter incrementing and decrementing on each set, now we have 2 shift keys on a bool which doesn't work like an 'is key held?'

=demlinks-0.0.13
* made actions and functions ... thing
* if the src seems hard to read/understand remember that the text doesn't matter at all, really. It's the relations which imply connection, that matter ... hence this program.

=demlinks-0.0.12
LU: 17.Aug.2005
* removed KEYDEBUG from main
=demlinks-0.0.7
* temporary display of variables, on squares, use TAB to switch screens
=demlinks-0.0.5
* LU: 09 August 2005.
* TODO: transform any kind of input into generic input, then generic input into actions; an action means: on activation execute a function, on deactivation execute a(nother) function, if no deactivation function then the action gets deactivated after one (func) execution (while active). Like this:
        key   -\
         mouse-->-----> generic input ----> actions
        serial-/
 this means that take any one of key,mouse or serial(don't mix), many or one inputs of that type will be converted into one input of 'generic input' type; then take many or one inputs of 'generic input' type and they will be converted into one action; an actions consists of one procedure(function) that gets executed. Any of those five items are serial meaning they push items into a FIFO buffer. The buffer may be read at any time by executing software even if the necessary combinations aren't complete yet to fulfill the next stage(ie. incomplete key combination, thus generic input isn't triggered this time). Action can be of type: once OR continous. Once type, gets executed only once. Continous type, gets executed until the deactivation combination is received(that is, some generic input triggers the deactivate part of this action). This type of actions only trigger active if they previously were inactive, likewise only trigger deactivation if they were previously active. Actions may be triggered by user in any part of the program, also they can be disabled to stop checking if they occur but keeping their previous state. Actions are taken one at once and executed, thus u cannot cumulate actions to sum-up to another action, use generic input type cumulation instead.
