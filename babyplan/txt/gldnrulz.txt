dmental links rules:
1. eatoms are uniq, for example #0..#255 character types, there can't be two
	eatoms with the same #char !!
2. groups are never refered by the gcatoms contained within a group. One should
	create a gcatom outside the group (which will be single), and point the
	former gcatom(within the group) which now becoms an acatom to this single
	gcatom. This way, we can hm.... IGNORE this rule for now, until we think
	about it.
