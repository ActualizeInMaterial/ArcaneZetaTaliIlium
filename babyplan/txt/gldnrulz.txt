dmental links rules:
1. eatoms are uniq, for example #0..#255 character types, there can't be two
    eatoms with the same #char !!
2. groups are never refered by the gcatoms contained within a group. One should
    create a gcatom outside the group (which will be single), and point the
    former gcatom(within the group) which now becoms an acatom to this single
    gcatom. This way, we can hm.... IGNORE this rule for now, until we think
    about it.
3. eatoms cannot be a part of a chain, they are single, use an acatom that
    refers to an eatom, and make that acatom part of the chain.
