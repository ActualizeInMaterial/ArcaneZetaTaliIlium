dmental links rules:
1. eatoms are uniq, for example #0..#255 character types, there can't be two
    eatoms with the same #char !!
2. it's at least 50% all about conventions, bad rules can make a mess of the
    world. Links(references/connections), ordered chains and conventions.
3. eatoms cannot be a part of a chain, they are single, use an acatom that
    refers to an eatom, and make that acatom part of the chain. Also this implies
    that eatoms cannot be part of any group, they cannot be in a group.
4. any atomID can be part of a chain, but if it is, then it's part of only one
   chain (ie. the same atomID cannot be part of two or more chains : for this
   we must make another atomID type AC which refers to our initial atomID and
   then add this to another chain)
5. no infinite recursions
