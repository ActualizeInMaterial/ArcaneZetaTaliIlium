reasons for coding style:

1. symbol names:
	not going to use:
some-weird-multi-word-symbol
	but instead
some_weird_multi_word_symbol

	because the latter can be double cliked (in eclipse/ccw) to be fully selected
	instead of the former getting only one of those words selected.

2. fail-fast system
basically, test for (both at compile time and runtime)errors and fail as soon as they're encountered
 this should propagate the exception but most importantly I'd catch bugs as soon as they occur 
 rather than later in different piece of code 

3. new-ing java classes should be:
(new ClassName ctor_params)
	instead of 
(ClassName. ctor_params)

	because it's clearer!
