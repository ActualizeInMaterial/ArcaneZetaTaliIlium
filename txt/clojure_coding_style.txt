reasons for coding style:

1. symbol names:
	not going to use:
some-weird-multi-word-symbol
	but instead
some_weird_multi_word_symbol

	because the latter can be double cliked (in eclipse/ccw) to be fully selected
	instead of the former getting only one of those words selected.

2. fail-fast system
