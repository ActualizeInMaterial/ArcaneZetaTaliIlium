BEWARE:

1. in junit don't use this construct:
try {
	parent.appendChild( null );
	fail();
} catch ( final AssertionError e ) {
}

because fail() will throw AssertionError, so if you were expecting to catch appendChild's AssertionError, you can't be sure it
wasn't fail() who threw it;

so then, use `throw null` instead; unless you're trying to catch NullPointerException, then it's no good again;

use Q.fail() it will throw a subclass of Error

so use this:
	try {
		parent.appendChild( null );
		Q.fail();//this throws a child of Error, so don't catch Error :P if you do, use `throw null` here instead;
	} catch ( final AssertionError e ) {
	}



2. // XXX: maybe reuse? instead of new-ing all the time 
!!- no reusing! to catch bugs is better new-ing; with reuse we may
 even induce new bugs! for now, it's good that we catch usage of == instead of .equals()
