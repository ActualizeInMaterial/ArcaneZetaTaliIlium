# respeccing

respeccing is (a work in progress) something to improve accessibility... (FIXME)  
Maybe it's like replacing RAM(random access memory) with graphs(edges&nodes) and use that as a foundation for building up systems and subsystems (stacked CPUs+databases?)  
The project name (respeccing) is temporary.

## Usage

FIXME: nothing here yet, we'll go the Rust way soon. (but I need to install GuixSD first and likely learn how to use emacs, and guile/scheme ...)

FIXME: what's the unlicense equivalent of the above ^ ?!! TELL ME!!!! (If it's CC0, then I don't know how to use it! and unlicense seems to apply only to software/code)
